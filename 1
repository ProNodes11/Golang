        "description": "This proposal is to approve reallocation of current LP farming rewards of Terra’s LUNA and UST paired pools in preemptive action for introducing new pool pairs in the near future. \n  \n The grounds for decision making are as follows: \n  \n- LUNA and UST pool incentivizations were implemented to invite liquidity from Terra, which maintained its position as a core Cosmos Ecosystem. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the current tokenomics of UST have created reason for providing investment alternatives for users of Crescent. \n- As of now, LUNA, a representative token of the Terra Ecosystem, has a probability of no longer maintaining an ecosystem that presents a stable coin functionality for Crescent DEX. \n- As can be observed by the extreme APR hike on said pools, Terra-based pools have significantly decreased in investment demand and prolonged allocation of LP incentives to LUNA and UST pools present degraded efficiency of liquidity and rewards allocation. \n  \n If passed, Liquidity Pool Pairs and their farming weights will be adjusted to the below: \n  \n- bCRE / CRE: 25% \n- bCRE / UST: 0% \n- ATOM / bCRE: 35% \n- LUNA / bCRE: 0% \n- ATOM / UST: 0% \n- LUNA / UST: 0% \n- Module Account: 40% \n  \n In order to expand the integration of pool pairs that will benefit Crescent Network, the unrewarded LP farming rewards of the LUNA and UST pools will be accumulated in a module account, which can be released to newly introduced pools in the near future for increased incentivization to migrate liquidity from external blockchains. \n  \n Under the guidance of the community approved Crescent Ethos, the foundation will continue extensive research into alternative assets to be integrated into Crescent DEX.",

        "title": "Reallocation of LP Farming Plan to include minimal incentives of bridged assets",
        "description": "1. Introduction\n    \n    This governance proposal is to launch initial minimal farming reward for bridge assets from Axelar and Gravity Bridge. Incentivized assets include ETH and USDC.\n    \n    Crescent Network would like to adopt assets from the bridges to provide users more variety of options for trading and LP investment.\n    \n    However, because the security of both bridges are not fully reviewed by Crescent Team yet, the amount of farming rewards for these assets will be relatively small, until we have enough confidence on the security of the bridges in the future.\n    \n    The newly incentivized pools are a result of the previously announced community discussion that took place at Crescent Network Commonwealth for 7 days. The key takeaway was to introduce and implement incentives to the ETH / bCRE pool in addition to the proposed bCRE / USDC pool.\n    \n    Reasoning for the immediate incentivization and consideration of other bridged assets can be found at the Commonwealth Proposal Discussion:\n    \n    https://commonwealth.im/crescent-forum/discussion/4962-minimal-incentivization-of-bridged-assets\n    \n2. Farming Plans\n    - New Assets on UI\n        - ETH.a : ETH from Axelar\n        - USDC.a : USDC from Axelar\n        - ETH.g : ETH from Gravity Bridge\n        - USDC.g : USDC from Gravity Bridge\n    \n    - Newly Incentivized Farming Pools\n        - bCRE / USDC.axl : 1%\n        - bCRE / USDC.grv : 1%\n        - ETH.axl / bCRE : 1%\n        - ETH.grv / bCRE : 1%\n    \n    - Existing Incentivized Farming Pools and Module Account\n        - CRE / bCRE : 25%\n        - ATOM / bCRE : 35%\n        - Module Account : 36%\n        \n        The module account will continue to be released to newly introduced pools in the near future for increased incentivization to migrate liquidity from external blockchains.\n        \n3. Reasoning\n    - Bridges\n        - Most active bridges in Cosmos Ecosystem\n        - Active partnership under progress with Crescent Team\n        - Minimum necessary evidence of security is satisfied\n    - Assets\n        - ETH\n            - The most popular asset for many DeFi products\n            - Having the second biggest market capital in crypto\n        - USDC\n            - Stable coin with 100% backed by fiat\n            - Most secure stable coin with no significant systemic risk\n    - Minimal Amount of Initial Farming (1% farming weight each)\n        - Initial farming rewards will be minimal because the security of both bridges are not fully reviewed by Crescent Team yet\n        - We will suggest higher farming rewards for the bridge assets when the team has stronger confidence in both bridge technologies\n        \n4. Future Plans\n    - for bCRE / ETH pools\n        - gradually increase the farming rewards to form deeper liquidity once security and ecosystem contribution of bridged assets are assessed\n    - for ETH / ETH \u0026 USDC / USDC pools\n        - **in June :** farming rewards will be migrated to “**Ranged LP**” to provide significantly amplified liquidity from smaller TVL\n    - for ETH / USDC pools\n        - **in July :**  large liquidity will be provided into orderbook when “**Market Maker Incentive**” alive\n\n5. Considerations\n    - The assets from both bridges are not fully reviewed by Crescent Team yet.\n    - Security risk upon each bridge should be fully acknowledged who decides to possess such assets in Crescent Network.",

        "description": "In alignment with Crescent Network’s principle of smoothly onboarding users, the necessity for testing new utilities is apparent. Keeping in mind that in an ecosystem flooded by traditional AMM DEXs, Crescent aims to provide a hybrid trading experience that synergizes AMM and orderbook.\n\nWith the imminent launch of orderbook and ranged liquidity UI, the foundation will invite users to test and get to know Crescent’s new utilities through the mooncat-1-1 testnet. When the testnet is opened publicly, users can experience the innovative feature before its debut on mainnet.\n\nBeing a core function of Crescent DEX, and one that is highly anticipated by users, we want to incorporate the community in the road to a perfect orderbook and ranged liquidity that can be utilized smoothly by all.\n\nAs a team that always prioritizes user safety and the integrity of the network, we would like users’ feedback, both on an experience basis, as well as technical. With that, we propose the allocation of 100,000 CRE from the Community Fund to be utilized in a Bug Bounty on the Crescent testnet. This will make sure that those actively participating in the improvement of our network will be accurately rewarded.\n\nIn the case of a bug being reported and scored among the eligible criteria(Criteria below), the user will be rewarded via the Foundation’s multi-sig wallet(cre1u9jxn6l7seq5jjej4w6etpdxufphwfuunljr4e), which will receive and distribute the bug bounty rewards, and the remaining funds will be returned to the Community Fund. The distribution of each rewarded case will be reported to the community for clarity and visibility.\n\nUsers participating in the testnet can report found bugs through the Bug Reporting Form (To be announced upon opening of public testnet), upon which it will be categorized and judged by the Foundation according to the level of importance stated below:\n\n- Critical: 20,000 CRE\n    - Exploitation of liquidity, chain halting, stolen funds, token inflation bug\n- Major: 5000 CRE\n    - Orderbook specific core bug other than Critical bug, limited financial exploitation\n- Minor:  500 CRE\n    - Judged case-by-case\n    - *Note that MOST front-end bugs will be categorized as Minor unless deemed critical to the network\n\nThe rewarding will be based on first-come-first serve, and repeated or already reported bugs will not be rewarded again.\n\nAs always, the Crescent Network team always appreciates the participation of the vibrant community, and we would like to continue building together for a prolonged sustainable and secure service for Cosmonauts and beyond. Through the cooperative testing between the dev team and our great community, we will work towards orderbook and ranged liquidity UI that have smooth UX with airtight security. ",

        "description": "Reallocation of LP farming plan to include ranged pools\n\nThis governance proposal is to initiate reallocation of the current farming plan to accommodate newly created pools and bootstrap ranged liquidity, as part of Crescent Network’s vision of capital-efficient and sustainable liquidity.\n\nThe current farming plan consists heavily on the: ATOM/bCRE, and bCRE/CRE pairs, with minimal incentives allocated to pairs with bridged assets. The plan secured liquidity in the native assets of Crescent Network and the Cosmos Ecosystem.\n\nWith the introduction of ranged liquidity on Crescent DEX, the farming weights need to be adjusted to accurately reward liquidity providers, create investment alternatives through ranged pools, and ultimately establish sufficient liquidity in pools that will synergize with Crescent Boost. In the case of the bCRE/CRE pool, the amplification of a user’s provided liquidity will be appx. 54X, and for ETH/ETH and USDC/USDC, 200X, resulting in more effective liquidity within the set range of the pools.\n\nAs stated in the Crescent Ethos, the network will focus on stable and major tokens, with this allocation plan to vitalize ATOM and USDC, which are key assets as well as pools such as ATOM/USDC to be used in Crescent Boost by becoming the target pairs of the new upcoming utility. ETH liquidity will be more available for trading through Market Maker incentives in October, and expanded investment opportunities once key utilities are firmly established.\n\nThe proposed reallocation of farming weights is as below:\n\n- Newly Incentivized Farming Pools\n    - bCRE / CRE Ranged Pool (1.063~1.15): 5%\n    - ATOM / USDC.axl: 10%\n    - ATOM / USDC.grv: 10%\n    - ETH.axl / ETH.grv Ranged Pool(±1%): 2%\n    - USDC.axl / USDC.grv Ranged Pool(±1%): 2%\n    - GRAV / bCRE: 1% (For 50 days from passing of proposal)\n- Farming Weight Adjustment\n    - bCRE / CRE: 25% \u003e 20%\n    - bCRE / USDC.axl: 1% \u003e 5%\n    - bCRE / USDC.grv: 1% \u003e 5%\n    - WETH.axl / bCRE: 1% \u003e 0%\n    - WETH.grv / bCRE 1% \u003e 0%\n    - Module Account: 36% \u003e 5%   \n",

        "description": "Reallocation of LP farming and creation of new pools\n\nThis governance proposal is to initiate reallocation of the current farming plan to include newly created pools and fully utilize the potential of ranged pools for maximum efficiency in trading experience.\n\nThe current farming plan has increased both liquidity and TVL within Crescent DEX. As can be seen by the existing ranged pools, the liquidity of ranged pools are amplified beyond that of basic pools, giving reason for migrating major pairs to implement range. Also, in the Crescent spirit of maximizing utility and efficiency of trading, certain pools have shown no use-cases, exposing reason for being faded out.\n\nRealizing the capital-efficiency and liquidity amplification of ranged pools and orderbook, we must take into consideration of many new major tokens being launched on the Cosmos Ecosystem, and creating a sustainable market for them. According to the Crescent Ethos, our DEX will continue liquidity incubation for major tokens by utilizing our superior utilities.\n\nThe farming weights are always up for discussion, and will be adjusted to include newly launched tokens that have potential for synergy with Crescent DEX in the future according to governance and user demand.\n\nThe Foundation proposes the following farming weights below in consideration of newly listed assets, and capital-efficiency of ranged pools:\n\n- **Newly Incentivized Farming Pools**\n    - ATOM / bCRE Ranged Pool (20~100): 15%\n        - This pair has shown a relatively stable price range during the duration of its existence, giving reason to believe that a ranged pool is possible and will provide a better trading experience through liquidity amplification\n    - BLD / bCRE Ranged Pool (1.0~7.0): 3%\n        - Given the proposed price range, BLD / bCRE pair’s liquidity will be amplified, requiring less TVL for the same trading experience when compared to basic AMM of other DEXs\n        - Farming rewards will commence for 28 days from implementation\n    - GRAV / bCRE Ranged Pool (0.03~0.20): 3%\n        - Continued partnership with Gravity Bridge and expanded implementation of the team’s technology within Crescent DEX (Gravity Bridge to propose renewal of private GRAV incentives)\n    - bCRE / CRE Ranged Pool (1.10~1.20): 5%\n        - Introduction of a smaller farming weight for this pool, and will monitor TVL changes and adjust according to user demand\n- **Farming Weight Adjustment**\n    - bCRE / CRE (Basic Pool): 20% \u003e 10%\n        - Will possibly be replaced with ranged pool as the price discrepancy is predictable\n    - ATOM/bCRE (Basic Pool): 35% \u003e 20%\n        - Possible migration to ranged pool, will monitor changes in TVL and liquidity to adjust accordingly\n    - Reserve(Module Account): 5% \u003e 17%\n        - To be utilized in the incentivization of newly listed tokens\n- **Discontinuation of Farming Rewards**\n    - bCRE / USDC.axl: 5% \u003e 0%\n        - Small trade volume, and can be replaced by multi-hop swap through ATOM\n    - bCRE / USDC.grv: 5% \u003e 0%\n        - Same as above\n    - ETH.axl / ETH.grv Ranged Pool(±1%): 2% \u003e 0%\n        - Relatively small trade volume, and does not have a practical use-case for Crescent DEX\n    - GRAV / bCRE (Basic Pool): 1% \u003e 0%\n        - Replaced by Ranged Pool above for more efficient liquidity\n- **Unchanged Farming Weights**\n    - ATOM / USDC.axl: 10%\n    - ATOM / USDC.grv: 10%\n    - USDC.axl / USDC.grv Ranged Pool (0.99~1.01): 2%\n    - bCRE / CRE Ranged Pool (1.063~1.15): 5%\n- **Note**\n    - Market Maker Incentives will be implemented for WBTC, ETH, ATOM / USDC pairs in the coming months",

We added CRE to Citadel.one mobile wallet - learn more via the link (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/citadel-one/id1546701475?ign-mpt=uo%3D2 OR https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=one.citadel.mobile\u0026gl=NL) + We added CRE into Citadel.one Autorestaking Application (https://medium.com/citadel-one/autorestake-app-overview-ebefaecb38d2). In future, we can integrate the main product of Crescent inside Citadel.one app store and add CRE to our governance extension.\n\nWhat is your long-term plan to sustain the Crescent node?\n\n: We use Grafana for monitoring of our nodes' CPU load, uptime, current and missed blocks and random-access memory usage. ELK Stack software for building analytics, errors search, failure mode and effects analysis. Zabbix for hardware, hard disk and memory load monitoring. And Telegram bot that sends notifications if something out of order occurs. As for the marketing perspective, we are always in touch with the community so the support is always provided. Additionally, for staking with our node, users receive additional bonuses in XCT.\n\nInfra specs and operation specs\n\n:Mixed cloud (AWS) and bare-metal (OVHcloud) infrastructure. Running validator, backup/RPC nodes. Specs varies between networks - from 4 CPU 16 RAM to 16 CPU 64 RAM depending on the network workload. Running NVMe disks on all of the machines"

We always vote on all governance proposals and we make all of our community aware by communicating our decisions via Twitter. We also have an RPC/LCD endpoint load balancer service. It aggregates several public and private nodes and the requests are routed among them. This service has many features like health checks, retires on errors and 10s timeouts, CORS-enabled requests, caching, etc. We could integrate Crescent into it if the team thinks it would be helpful. Another service we provide is a multi-coin mainnet faucet, where we currently have Crescent integrated (https://stakely.io/en/faucet/crescent). This service distributes a small amount of mainnet tokens to the users that have run out of gas. It can help bring more people to the project and improve the network's user experience. We will continue maintaining this service and refilling the faucet with our own funds. As an additional contribution, we are planning to build Docker images for most of the Cosmos-based chains, including Crescent.\n\nWhat is your long-term plan to sustain the Crescent node?\n\n: We estimate that the rewards obtained from delegations will be enough to pay for the maintenance of the validator. There are other income sources that we can study, like offering archive RPCs and white-label validators. In case running the validator is not profitable in the future, we have enough income from other networks to continue maintaining it.\n\nInfra specs and operation specs\n\n:Our Crescent validator runs in a bare metal server in Tokyo with the following specifications: CPU: Intel Xeon E-2286G - 6c/12t - 4 GHz/4.9 GHz Memory: 32GB Storage: 2 x 1TB SSD Raid 1 Bandwidth: 1000 Mbps We also have a full-node running for redundancy that we will use in case of any issues. It has the state-sync feature enabled which will help in case we needed to launch a new server. We have previously used tools like TMKMS but we decided to stop using them due to latency. We have also heard about Horcrux in the last months, and we are discussing using it in our setup. We use Prometheus, Zabbix, Grafana, and custom bash-scripts for our monitoring system. Prometheus sends us data from the system and node to Zabbix, where we manage the notifications and alerts for system metrics Grafana is used for visual metrics of server and node historical data Custom bash scripts for alerts like node not-in-sync, low number of peers, high system usage, missed blocks, etc. that notifies us in our private Discord server.\n\nDetails for this section can be found at the following IPFS link below.\n\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPxaSYSvTKdo12ZmJ2EubEhrvyTWVp78ahjiN9A9fvGqe"

The current dashboard has validator performance history, calculator, network statistics, governance participation /proposals. We have plans to build 10+ more features in the current dashboard. As the community evolves and it has more specific needs, we will build more tools. Smart Stake's custom analytics provide answers to common questions of the community and is looking forward to help improve the engagement level in Crescent.\n\nWhat is your long-term plan to sustain the Crescent node?\n\n: Smart Stake has only one source of revenue (commission from staking rewards). It will continue to support the Crescent validator from its commission from other networks and looks forward to inclusion in LSV for covering Crescent nodes expenses eventually.\n\nInfra specs and operation specs\n\n: Smart Stake hardens every server node with a standard setup where root access is removed, ssh keys are used for authentication, firewalls are installed, failban is used to limit unwanted access attempts. All validator nodes have a corresponding hot backup of all validators. For networks requiring high throughput, we do not use sentry node architecture unless needed for a particular project or where the threat vectors are higher. We use custom scripting to watch for server metrics, node performance, node sync status, signs missed, oracle performance. Pagerduty workflows are also in place to place calls/sms/push notifications whenever anomalies are detected. The scripting has several failsafe mechanisms built in to ensure if the scripting fails, that itself generates alerts."

        "description": "Crescent is a team that continues a commitment to providing innovative DeFi solutions and public infrastructure. In doing so, we understand that users may require time to familiarize themselves with the novelty and unique traits of DeFi utilities that Crescent Network provides for the Cosmos Ecosystem.\nIn July, we received various well-analyzed contributions through our first Bug Bounty, of which many were implemented into our mainnet, successfully serving its purpose of retaining security and improving user experience for features never before seen on Cosmos.\nWe aim to introduce the following utilities in our V3 upgrade on Crescent Network:\nLiquid Farming\nMarket Maker Incentives\nFarming Version 2.0\nMobile orderbook UI\nIn anticipation for the game-changing upgrades of Crescent V3, we would like to invite all users to test new functions prior to launch on the mainnet. As a team that focuses both on DeFi innovations and community engagement alike, we acknowledge the capabilities of our users.\nThe Crescent Foundation proposes the allocation of 300,000 CRE from the Community Fund to be utilized in a Bug Bounty on the Crescent testnet. This will make sure that those actively participating in the improvement of our network will be accurately rewarded.\nThe Crescent Rehearsal will commence on November 24, lasting until December 1, during which time users will be able to submit feedback and content of the following categories:\nBug Bounty:\nSubmitted via the Crescent Bug Reporting Form (To be provided at the beginning of testnet)\nCritical: 50000 CRE\n• Exploitation of liquidity, chain halting, stolen funds, token inflation bug\nMajor: 5000 CRE\nLiquid Farming, Market Maker Incentives, and Farming V2 specific core bug other than Critical bug, limited financial exploitation\nMinor: 200 CRE\nJudged case-by-case\nNote that MOST front-end bugs will be categorized as Minor unless deemed critical to the network\nThe rewarding will be based on first-report-first-reward basis, with repeated and already reported bugs being ineligible for rewarding.\nThe rewarding of each eligible case will be reviewed by the Foundation and presented to the community through governance upon completion of the Bug Bounty. Upon passing of the proposal, each eligible user will be rewarded their corresponding CRE for their contribution to development of secure utilities.\nIn the case of a bug being reported and scored among the eligible criteria(Criteria below), the user will be rewarded via the Foundation’s multi-sig wallet(cre1u9jxn6l7seq5jjej4w6etpdxufphwfuunljr4e), which will receive and distribute the bug bounty rewards, and the remaining funds will be returned to the Community Fund. \n\nCrescent Academy(Utility Education): \nIn order to promote a community culture of shared educational and entertainment content,we will start the implementation of the Crescent Academy. \nThe purpose of this school is to allow people involved in educational content creation to participate in the evolution of Crescent and the education of the newcomers. \nThe goal here is to make content easy to understand and available for everyone who joins our community. These contents can be: \nYoutube videos\nTwitter threads\nMedium articles\nEtc. \nThese contents should talk about the testnet and what V3 upgrade will introduce: \nLiquid Farming \nMarket Maker Incentives \nFarming Version 2.0 \nMobile orderbook UI \nthe goal is not to make a simple article, but especially to make complete contents, well explained such as: \nTutorial \nLiquid Farming explanation \nComparison between what we know and the new Crescent model \nAnd more. \nWe expect rich content with images, a clear editorial line and a fluid flow. \nThe reward of each eligible case will be reviewed by the Foundation and presented to the community on discord. \nYou will be limited to one piece of content per user, so take the time to choose it and polish it. You will have to submit your content using Crew3 and your review will be pending until the end of the bug bounty. \nEach eligible user will be rewarded their corresponding CRE for their contribution to development of the Crescent school.\nNote that the school will not only last during the bug bounty period, it will be part of Crescent structure.",

Blockchains are experimental technologies, and we understand that it is in bad times that proactive validators are the most needed. With 24/7 on-call rotation and monitoring, we will be available for emergency situations at the validator level but also for network-related emergencies.\nGovernance: vote on all key proposals and join the decentralized governance debate, inviting the community and delegators to contribute as well. Every week we share a weekly governance recap on our different social media platforms (Twitter, Discord), but also discuss proposals. So far we have voted on 100% of Crescent proposals.\nCommunity: we have a dedicated community manager working with the Cosmos ecosystem and Cosmos networks. We will assist the Crescent community with liquid staking, staking requests and join discussions in general.\nMarketing: we regularly publish content on our blog (https://blog.stakin.com/) and Medium (https://medium.com/stakin) which attract ~30,000 monthly readers. We believe that education is an important aspect of the growth of DeFi and DeFi products. As such, we will write and share content about Crescent with our community.\nOther services: we can operate other services such as Seeds, public RPCs, Snapshots, etc. if needed depending on the requirements of Crescent and the community.\n\nWhat is your long-term plan to sustain the Crescent node?\n\n: We will charge a 20% commission on staking rewards like the other validators that are part of the program.\n\nInfra specs and operation specs\n\n: We are currently running our validator in Tokyo with a sentry node architecture, leveraging multiple cloud providers (GCP, Vultr) for diversity and redundancy. As we are using the cloud, we can increase the specs easily if needed. Currently, we are running with 8 CPUs, 32 GB RAM, and 1TB SSD.\n\nSentry nodes are connected to the validator in private mode using a VPN tunnel for latency and security. Sentries are open to the public network and keep in sync with the network while providing DDOS protection. For further protection, only required ports are open for both sentries and validators.\n\nThe company has a strict role management policy for access to production infrastructure including servers operating sentry nodes and validators.\n\nThe developers operate via ZTNA, with strict rules for SSH login and IP whitelists. All accesses are logged and monitored. Infrastructure secrets are encrypted and stored in secure HashiCorp vaults. Credentials, passwords and tokens are generated, stored and rotated from the vault.\n\nDetails for this section can be found at the following IPFS link below:\n\nhttps://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmeBfywbWsTmsU5AkKpaKPmPNSPZP5QVZELjnMRCBFhBQu"

        "description": "According to the last announcement for adding a new Liquid Staking Validator, we got an LSV application form for 2 weeks and a feedback period for 1 week. Based on the scoring system that we opened and discussed on the commonwealth, we extracted the top 3 candidates out of 16 candidates. \n\nIn order to align with the principles of blockchain and Cosmos alike, decentralization should be at the heart of Crescent. Therefore, we would like to onboard two validator teams for this round of voting, upon which the two teams with the highest votes will be included in the current LSV, in an effort to further pursue decentralization\n\nFor this round, top 2 validators will be added to the LSV governance voting.\n\nVoting YES to this proposal means that you approve ‘[polkachu.com](http://polkachu.com/)’ to be adopted as a new liquid staking validator.\n\nOnly YES votes will be counted. Voting NO, NO WITH VETO, or ABSTAIN will have no effect on which candidate is adopted. (However, when the number of the voting amount is significantly different among each candidate, No votes can be reflected)\n\nVoting procedures summary:\n\n- Existing LSV should not vote, and votes by existing LSV will not be counted for this proposal\n- Top 2 candidates that receives the highest number of CRE for ‘Yes’ voting, can only proceed to the next step\n- The final validator needs to be agreed upon via on-chain governance(existing LSV need to vote)\n- New LSV is added upon the passing of the governance proposal\n\nLink to the docs for all candidates scoring:\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C4A0RluUqxR0Qg_n7wd9jrrVFFehVw5l/edit?usp=sharing\u0026ouid=115407576662815838896\u0026rtpof=true\u0026sd=true \n\nHere’s the scoring system that was discussed before:\n\nhttps://commonwealth.im/crescent-forum/discussion/6614-amended-scoring-system-for-adding-new-lsv \n\n**Qualitative Scoring Criteria submitted by** [polkachu.com](http://polkachu.com/)\n\nHow will you contribute to the Crescent Ecosystem in the future?\n\n: We will continue to run the validation service and expand the IBC channels for Crescent. Will continue to contribute to the open-source projects.\n\nWhat is your long-term plan to sustain the Crescent node?\n\n: We have been sustaining the Crescent node in the active set in the past 6 months flawlessly. We will continue the same top-notch work that we have been doing.\n\nInfra specs and operation specs\n\n:See the writeup on our architecture, security policy, monitoring system, etc. https://polkachu.com/blogs/holy-trinity-a-system-approach-to-tendermint-based-chain-validation"
